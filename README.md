# To-Do-List-Manager
This app is made to be a basic to do list Manager that allows a user to add, read,
edit, and delete tasks, as well as set their priority. This project is made using
windows forms and MySQL Database. The program should also, eventually, allow for
users to login and have different tasks associated with different users.
